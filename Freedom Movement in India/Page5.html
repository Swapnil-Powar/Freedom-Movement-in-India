<p>The Indian National Congress was Established in 1885, to create National Consciousness among the Indians.
The first session of the Congress was held at Bombay and preceeded by W.C.Bannarji. The leaders who believed 
in bringing about political change through constitutional means were called Moderates. The leaders who believed
the British must be thrown out of the country by agitation were called extrimits. The congress split in 1907 at
the Surat session. Small groups of people who resorted to violent methods to throw the British out of the country
were called revelutionaries. 1920 to 1947 is known as the Gandhian Era. He believed in Non-Cooperation Movement
and non violent passive resistance called Satyagraha. The Khilafat movement joined the Non-Cooperation Movement
& campaigned for Hindu-Muslim Unity. Gandhiji started Civil Disobedience Movement with the Salt Satyagraha.
The British Government Sent the Cripps Mission to India proposing Dominion status to India if the Indians 
supported them in the Second World War. The Congress Rejected the Proposal & adopted the 'Quit India' resolution.
Subhash Chandra Bose, a revolutionary patriot leader, started the Indian National Army (INA). The Muslim League
demanded the creation of Pakistan. Mountbatten, who was appointed Viceroy to India in 1946, drew up a plan for
partition. The British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act in July 1947 and India became free in August
1947.
