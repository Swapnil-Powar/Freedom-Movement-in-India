<h2> <center> Establishment of British Rule in India </center> </h2>
<p>Since time immemorial trade was carried on by land through the city of Constantinople. In 1453 A.D. , the Ottoman Turks occupied Constantinople, which made it neccessary to explore new sea routes to <em> India </em>.
Portugal was the 1<sup>st</sup> country to launch voyages across the sea, The Portuguese n
avigator, Vasco-da-Gama reached the cost of calicut in 1498 A.D. Alphanso-de-Albuquerque came to <em> India </em> in 1509 and
strengthened the Portuguese rule in <em> India </em>. The successors of Albuquerque were weak & corrupt. In 1580 A.D. Portugal lost its independent existence as it merged with <i> Spain </i> for some time. The advent of
the portuguese paved the way for increased trade links between <em> Europe & India </em>. The 1<sup>st</sup> printing machiene was brought to Goa by the Portuguese. The <i> Dutch East India Company</i> established trade
centers in <em> India </em> in 1605 A.D. The <i> English East India Company </i> appointed Sir Thomas Roe as the English ambassador to the Mughul Court. The Portuguese presented the island of Bombay to the <i> East India
Company </i>. The <i> French East India Company </i> was Established in 1664 A.D. Dupleix was the 1<sup>st</sup> French Governer in <em> India </em>. In 1740 A.D. war broke out between the French and the English in Europe
This war had repercussion in <em> India </em>. 3 major <b> Carnatic Wars </b> were fought in <em> India </em>. The English army led by Sir Eyre Coote and the French army led by Bussy fought at Wandhiwash and the French
lost the Battle. The Carnatic wars reduced the french from being a major contendor of power. The French lost the battles, while the English were Victorious. The English army under Robert Clive met the Nawab at Plassey on
23<sup>rd</sup> June 1757 A.D. The English commandor Hector Munro defeated the combined forces of Mir Kasim, Shuja-ud-Daulah and Shah Alam II at Buxar in 1764 A.D. In 1765 A.D. Robert Clive became the Governer of the 
East India Company and introduced the Dual Government in Bengal (According to this system, the company collected the revenue and the Nawab looked after the over all administration and also the administration of Justice.
This enabled the Britsh to collect the taxes without being responsible for the administration). </p>
<p>By the begining of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the <i>English</i> power in <em> India </em> secured  a firm foundation. Governer general </b> Wellesley</b>'s Subsidiary Alliance was especially helpful in this process.
This policy helped the <i> British </i> to expand their empire and to gain control over the native rulers.The nativer rulers who had entered into the subsidiary alliance were not expected to engage themseleves in wars
or to enter into treaties with other states. The native ruler was to accept an <i> English </i> contingent in his state and pay (subsidy) for the maintainance of the contingent. An <i> English </i> residant was kept at
the court of the nativer ruler. The <i> English </i> were able to keep control over the internal affairs of the native rulers. The <i> Nizam of Hydarabad </i> was the first ruler to accept these alliance (1798 A.D.).
The <i> Peshwa </i> the king of Travancore, Nawab Sadat Ali of Avadh and others accepted the alliance.The administration of many subordinate states was taken over by Wellesly under the pretext of mal-administration
which included Tanjavur, Arcot and Farrukabad. The presidencies of Madras and Bengal came to have territorial continuity during his time.</p>
<p>In 1775 A.D. Raghunathrao concluded the Treaty of Surat with the English Government. Warren Hastings entered into the Treaty of Purandhar with Nana Phadhanvis in 1776 A.D. Bajirao II bacame the Peshwa(1796 A.D -
1818 A.D.). He was the last Peshwa. The Peshwas, Holkar, Sindhia, Gaikwad and Bhosale accepted the Subsidary Alliance. Thus ended the Maratha power. Renowned as the "Lion of Punjab", Ranjith Singh was the famous
ruler of the Sikhs. Ranjith Singh signed the Treaty of Amrithsar with the English in 1809 A.D. The army of the Sikh community the "Khalsa", was won over by the Prime Minister Lal Singh and in 1845 A.D. he declared war
against the English. General Napier defeated the Sikhs at Jallianwala in 1849 A.D. and the rule of the sikhs came to an end.</p>
